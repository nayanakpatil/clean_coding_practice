# clean_coding_practice


understandable part:
1. If statements:
i rate myself 8/10 in understanding the code

 if (temperature > 35.0) {
            cout << "ALERT: High temperature detected (Environment)" << endl;

if (dimensionVariation > 0.05) {
            cout << "ALERT: Part-dimension variation too high (Machine)" << endl;

 if (continuousOperationMinutes > 360) {
            cout << "ALERT: Continuous operation exceeded 6 hours (Machine)" << endl;


2. Switch case also clear

3.  main function also clear
